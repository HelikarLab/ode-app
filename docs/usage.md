## General functions

### Import a SBML model

> Only .sbml/.xml files supported

### Use a saved model

![Saved Models Demo](assets/demo-saved-models.gif)

## Model Tab

### View Reactions/Species of a model

Click on a reaction/specie to view it on the info panel.

### View the model visualized in a network graph

Drag and zoom on the graph panel. You can also switch the compartments to display compartment-wise reactions and species.

- Blue Circles -> Specie Nodes
- Red Circles -> Reaction Nodes
- Green line -> Reactant Edge
- Yellow line -> Product Edge
- Dotted line - Reversible reactions

### Save a model

Saving a model stores it in the database which will let you directly fetch it later without doing an import.
