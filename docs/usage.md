### View the model visualized in a network graph

Drag and zoom on the graph panel. You can also switch the compartments to display compartment-wise reactions and species.

- Blue Circles -> Specie Nodes
- Red Circles -> Reaction Nodes
- Green line -> Reactant Edge
- Yellow line -> Product Edge
- Dotted line - Reversible reactions

### Save a model

Saving a model stores it in the database which will let you directly fetch it later without doing an import.
